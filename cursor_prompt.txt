I ran a STRICTLY READ-ONLY production logging audit tool on my ArrowSystems project (located at C:\Users\ethan\ArrowSystems). The tool scans production Python code only (excludes tests) and generates a Markdown report analyzing logging patterns.

The tool uses AST-based analysis to:
- Identify logging systems (stdlib logging, structlog, unknown)
- Count logger calls by level (debug/info/warning/error/critical/exception)
- Extract unique error message templates from error-like calls
- Find logging configuration points (basicConfig, structlog.configure) and classify entry-point risks
- Detect issues like bare except blocks, high print() usage, multiple basicConfig calls

I've attached report.md which shows:
- 79 production files scanned, 21 test files excluded
- stdlib logging: 1,049 calls; structlog: 1 call
- 195 error-like calls with 154 unique templates
- Top files: backend\orchestrator.py (241 calls), backend\api.py (223 calls, 70 error calls)
- 4 basicConfig() calls (3 at import-time - high risk)
- 632 print() calls (321 outside scripts/)
- 9 bare except blocks found

Please validate this report:
1. Are the logging system detections accurate? (stdlib + structlog)
2. Do the file counts and top files match expectations?
3. Are the 195 error-like calls and 154 unique templates reasonable?
4. Are the basicConfig() locations and entry-point classifications correct?
5. Are the bare except blocks actually at those file/line locations?
6. Did the tool correctly exclude test files from all metrics?
7. Do the totals reconcile? (e.g., level distribution = 1,050 matches stdlib + structlog)

Check for any inaccuracies, confirm what looks correct, and note if anything important was missed. The tool should be production-only (no test files in metrics).
